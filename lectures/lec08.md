# Project Scope and Design

## Learning Objectives

## Textbook

## Activities

1. Understanding requirements
   1. formal processes
   1. research software
      * initial requirements
      * planning for future requirements
   1. demonstrate with project ideas

1. Developing project plan
   1. Stages of development
      * scope - dimensionality, types of boundary/interface conditions, etc
      * complexity - physics approximations, linearity, etx
      * algorithmic breakdown - input, processing steps, output
   1. demonstrate with project ideas

1. Designing data models and interfaces
   1. Many reason to break project into distinct pieces with well-defined
      interfaces
      * division of labor
      * separation of concerns
      * reviewability
   1. all components must share the same data model
      * how will data be shared among components
      * balance between flexibility and simplicity
      * depends heavily on features of language
        * object-oriented
        * advanced containers
   1. define interfaces
      * input, output, behavior
