Description
-----------

Scientific software development has transitioned from a field devoted almost
entirely to numerical methods to one that increasingly relies on more advanced
management of data and development of analysis workflows that involve multiple
tools strung together in a sequence, and also numerical methods.

This course is designed to introduce a variety of concepts that will make
engineers and scientists more effective at developing software that
facilitates modern engineering analysis.

Teaching and Learning Philosophy
--------------------------------

Successful learners take ownership of their own learning and seek guidance
from the instructor to guide their learning process.  The instructor's role is
to chart a course through the material that will expose students to the
concepts they need with appropriate examples.  The student's role is to pursue
the course set the instrutor with a curious thirst for the nuances and details
of the concepts they experience along the way.

Code of Conduct
---------------

Please treat this classroom like a modern professional work environment:

* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
  including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery
  is not appropriate for any event.
  
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
  exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
  following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks
  or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
  attention.

* Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation. All students
  in this course are expected to value the contributions of each person and
  respect the ways in which their identity, culture, background, experience,
  status, abilities, and opinion enrich our learning experience and university
  community.

* Disrespectful behavior or comments directed toward any group or individual
  will be addressed by the instructor.

* Academic Integrity is critical to the mission of the University of
  Wisconsin-Madison, a research institution with high academic standards and
  rigor. All members of the University community play a role in fostering an
  environment in which student learning is achieved in a fair, just, and
  honest way.

Additional Resources
--------------------

* The `Greater University Tutoring Service (GUTS)<http://www.guts.wisc.edu/>`_
  is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) supported by segregated fees and
  dedicated to connecting UW students with volunteer tutors for assistance
  with academic courses, study skills, conversational English, and
  intercultural exchange. We provide free tutoring and mentoring to hundreds
  of students and university affiliates each semester!

* `Tutoring-by-Request
  (TBR)<https://www.engr.wisc.edu/academics/student-services/ulc/tutoring-by-request/>`_
  is a privately funded program that allows authorized students to obtain
  one-on-one help from tutors for a number of different courses. Typically TBR
  provides tutors for over 60 courses engineering students commonly take.

* Becoming a member of the `UW Student Section of the American Nuclear
  Society<http://www.atomicbadger.org/>`_ is a great way to start your
  participation in a professional organization related to your field, offering
  social and professional opportunities throughout the year.  It can also be
  an important place to find academic help from peers or older students.

* `UHS mental health providers<https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/mental-health/>`_
  understand the complexities of student life and offer an open, safe, and
  confidential environment to help students through issues that may interfere
  with their well-being, academic productivity, and happiness.
